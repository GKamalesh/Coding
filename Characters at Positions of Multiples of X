Characters at Positions of Multiples of X 

Given a string S and an integer X as input, the program must print the characters at the positions of multiples of X until the last character is printed. If the multiple of X goes beyond the last character, then the string characters should be navigated in a cyclic manner till the last character is printed.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= length of string <= 100
1 <= X <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains the string S and the value of X separated by space(s).

Output Format:
The first line contains the characters at the positions of multiples of X until the last character of the string S.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
denomination 8

Output:
aon

Explanation:
The character at the first multiple of 8 is 'a'.
Since the second multiple of 8 is beyond the last character of the string, consider the string in a cyclic manner. Then the character at the second multiple of 8 is 'o'.
Similarly, the character at the third multiple of 8 is 'n' and also it is the last character of the string.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
importance 2

Output:
motne

Explanation:
The character at the first multiple of 2 is 'm'.
The character at the second multiple of 2 is 'o'.
The character at the third multiple of 2 is 't'.
The character at the fourth multiple of 2 is 'n'.
The character at the fifth multiple of 2 is 'e' and also it is the last character of the string S.



#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i,n,m; 
    char a[1000];
    scanf("%s",a);
    scanf("%d",&m);
    n=strlen(a);
    i=m-1;
    while(i!=n-1) 
    {
        if(i>n-1)
        i=i-n; 
        else
        {
        printf("%c",a[i]);
        i+=m;
        }
    }
    printf("%c",a[n-1]);    
    return 0;
}
