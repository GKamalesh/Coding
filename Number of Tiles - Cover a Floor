Number of Tiles - Cover a Floor
The floor of a rectangular playground is to be covered using square tiles. The area of the playground as X and side of a square tile as Y
are passed as the input to the program. The program must print the number of tiles used to cover the floor as the output.
Note: All the tiles are of the same size. The length and breadth of the playground are divisible by Y.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X <= 10^8
1 <= Y <= 10^4
Input Format:
The first line contains two integers X and Y separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the number of tiles used to cover the floor.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
24 2
Output:
6
Explanation:
The side of each square tile is 2. So the area of a tile is 4.
The area of the rectangular playground is 24.
The number of tiles used to cover the floor 24/4 = 6.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3200 20
Output:
8



m,n=map(int,input().split())
print((m)//n**2)
