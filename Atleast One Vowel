Atleast One Vowel
The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must print the word(s) which contains atleast one vowel. If all the words contain
only consonants then the program must print -1 as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 1000
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
The Sky is Blue
Output:
The is Blue
    
Explanation:
The word "The" contains one vowel e.
The word "Sky" contains no vowel.
The word "is" contains one vowel i.
The word "Blue" contains two vowels u and e.
Hence "The is Blue" is printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
Good Morning
Output:
Good Morning



a=list(map(str,input().split(" ")))
b=[]
for i in a:
    t=0
    for j in range(len(i)):
        if i[j]=='a' or i[j]=='A' or i[j]=='e' or i[j]=='E' or i[j]=='o' or i[j]=='O' or i[j]=='i' or i[j]=='I' or i[j]=='u' or i[j]=='U':
            t=1
            b.append(1)
            break
    if t==1:
        print(i,end=' ')
if len(b)==0:
    print("-1")
