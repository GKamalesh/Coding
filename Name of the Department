Name of the Department
In a competition, students from only two departments participated. The program must accept a string S consisting of only lowercase letters e
representing the students from ECE and c representing the students from CSE as the input. The program must print the name of the
department based on the majority number of students participated as the output. If equal number of students from both the departments
participated in it, then print ECE - CSE as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
5 <= Length of String S <= 99
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
eeccceececeee
Output:
ECE
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
cccceeeece
Output:
ECE - CSE
Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
ccecececcece
Output:
CSE
