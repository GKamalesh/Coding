Concatenate and Check Perfect Square
The program must accept two integers X and Y as the input. The program must concatenate both the integers and check whether the formed
integer is a perfect square or not. If the formed integer is a perfect square, then the program must print Yes. Else the program must print No as
the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X <= 10000
1 <= Y <= 10000
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of X and Y separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains either Yes or No.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
1 21
Output:
Yes
Explanation:
Integer values 1 and 21 can be concatenated as 211 and 121.
211 is not a perfect square. But 121 (11 * 11) is a perfect square.
Hence the output is Yes
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
2
65
Output:
No



a,b=map(str,input().split())
m=int(a+b)
n=int(b+a)
r=m**(1/2)
s=n**(1/2)
if r==int(r):
    print("Yes")
elif s==int(s):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
