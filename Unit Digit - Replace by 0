Unit Digit - Replace by 0
The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must replace all the occurrences of the
unit digit of N by 0 in the integer N. Finally, the program must print the modied value of N as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^8
Input Format:
The rst line contains the value of N.
Output Format:
The rst line contains the modied value of N.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
1021
Ouput:
20
Explanation:
The unit digit of 1021 is 1.
So after replacing all the occurrence of 1 by 0, the integer becomes 0020.
Hence the output is 20
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
202202
Ouput:
0



a=input().strip()
print(int(a.replace(a[-1],'0',a.count(a[-1]))))
