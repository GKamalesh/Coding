You are given a sequence of integers terminated with a -1. The -1 is
not part of the input sequence.


Next, you are given a positive number N.

You have to create a linked list with the input sequence of integers
as entries. You can use the following structure.

 struct node{
 	int data;
	struct node *next;
 };


Now, you have to delete all but the last N elements from the linked
list, and print the resulting list. (i.e. The resulting list will
consist of only the last N elements from the list.)


If N is longer than the length of the linked list, you must print -1.

While printing, the entries of the list must be separated by a single
space.
