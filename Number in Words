Number in Words
The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print each digit of N in words as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^7
Input Format:
The first line contains the integer N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the list of string values which represents each digit of N in words separated by a space(s).
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
2048
Output:
two zero four eight
Explanation:
The digit 2 in 2048 is converted into word as two.
The digit 0 in 2048 is converted into word as zero.
The digit 4 in 2048 is converted into word as four.
The digit 8 in 2048 is converted into word as eight.
Hence the output is two zero four eight
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
2019
Output:
two zero one nine



#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
int main()
{
    int i,t;
    char a[1000][1000]={"zero","one","two","three","four","five","six","seven","eight","nine"};
    char n[10000000];
    scanf("%s",n);
    for(i=0;i<strlen(n);i++)
    {
        t=n[i]-'0';
        printf("%s ",a[t]);
    }
}

a=['zero','one','two','three','four','five','six','seven','eight','nine']
for i in (input()):
    print(a[int(i)],end=" ")
