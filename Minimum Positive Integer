Minimum Positive Integer

The program must accept three integers X, Y and Z (where X < Y) as the input.
The program must print the minimum positive integer M such that M is divisible by Z 
and it does not belong to the range from X to Y (both inclusive).

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X, Y, Z <= 10^6

Input Format:
The first line contains the values of X, Y and Z separated by space(s).

Output Format:
The first line contains the value of M.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 52 5

Output:
55

Explanation:
The positive integers (excluding the range from 5 to 52) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57 and so on.
From the above positive integers, the minimum positive integer which is divisible by 5 is 55.
Hence the output is 55

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
1 5 1

Output:
6



a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
t,i=0,1
while t==0:
    if i<a or i>b:
        if i%c==0:
            print(i)
            t=1
            break
    i+=1
