Remove Consecutive Alphabets
The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must remove the subsequent  alphabets in S which are in the same case. Finally,
the program must print the modified string as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains the string S.
Output Format:
The first line contains the modified string.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
abcDEFghi
Output:
aDg
Explanation:
The consecutive lower case and upper case alphabets in the string "abcDEFghi" are "bc", "EF" and "hi".
After removing those consecutive alphabets in "abcDEFghi", the string becomes "aDg".
Hence the output is aDg
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
rDFjksdfGJejJKDbfgKrSDF
Output:
rDjGeJbKrS




a=input().strip()
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i==0:
        print(a[i],end="")
    elif (a[i].isupper() and a[i-1].isupper()) or (a[i].islower() and a[i-1].islower()):
        f=1
    else:
        print(a[i],end="")
