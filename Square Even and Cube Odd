Square Even and Cube Odd 

Given an array of integers of size N as input, the program must print the square of even elements and the cube of odd elements

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).

Output Format:
The first line contains N integers separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
2 3 7 4 1

Output:
4 27 343 16 1

Explanation:
For 1st element 2 is an even number->2*2 so print 4
For 2nd element 3 is an odd number->3*3*3 so print 27
For 3rd element 7 is an odd number->7*7*7 so print 343
For 4th element 4 is an even number->4*4 so print 16
For 5th element 1 is an odd number->1*1*1 so print 1

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4
10 9 6 3

Output:
100 729 36 27

Explanation:
For 1st element 100 is an even number->10*10 so print 100
For 2nd element 9 is an odd number->9*9*9 so print 729
For 3rd element 6 is an even number->6*6 so print 36
For 4th element 3 is an odd number->3*3*3 so print 27
