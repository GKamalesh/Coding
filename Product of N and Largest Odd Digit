Product of N and Largest Odd Digit
The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print the product of N and the largest odd digit in N as the
output. If there is no odd digit in N then the program must print -1 as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^8
Input Format:
The first line contains the integer N.
Output Format:
The first line contains either the product of N and the largest odd digit in N or -1.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
12345
Output:
61725
Explanation:
The largest odd digit in 12345 is 5.
The product of 12345 and 5 is 61725.
Hence the output is 61725
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
24068
Output:
-1




n=int(input())
m,t=n,0
while m>0:
    r=m%10
    if r>t and r%2==1:
        t=r
    m//=10
if t==0:
    n=1
    t=-1
print(n*t)
