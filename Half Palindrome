Half Palindrome

The program must accept a string S as the input. Either the first half of the string or the second half of the string is always a palindrome. The program must find and print the half of the string which forms a palindrome as the output.
Note: If the length of the string is odd then consider the middle character to be part of both halves.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of the string <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains the string S.

Output Format:
The first line contains either the first or second half of the string S.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
yumertreert

Output:
treert

Explanation:
The second half of the string treert is a palindrome so it is printed.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
madamello

Output:
madam




n=input().strip()
t=len(n)//2
if len(n)%2==1:
    t+=1
a=n[:t]
if len(n)%2==1:
    b=n[t-1:]
else:
    b=n[t:]
if a==a[::-1]:
    print(a)
else:
    print(b)
