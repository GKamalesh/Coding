Minimum Questions to be Correct
In an exam, there are N multiple choice questions. Each question carries 1 mark if it is answered correctly and If it is answered wrong then it
results in 1 negative mark. All the questions must be attempted. The program must accept two integers representing the number of questions
N and pass mark P as the input. The program must print the minimum number of questions needed to be correct to pass the exam.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N, P <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains N and P separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the minimum number of questions needed to be correct to pass the exam.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
20 10
Output:
15
Explanation:
There are 20 questions to be answered and so the total mark is 20.
If 15 questions are answered correctly the mark obtained is 15.
The remaining 5 questions carries 5 negative marks.
So the final mark is 15-5=10.
Hence 15 is printed.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
30 12
Output:
21




m,n=map(int,input().split())
for i in range(m):
    if m-i-i==n or m-i-i==n-1:
        print(n+i)
        break
