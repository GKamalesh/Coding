Sum of Words Length
The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must print the sum of the length of each word in the string S as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains string S.
Output Format:
The first line contains the sum of the length of each word in the string S.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
Prime Minister of India
Output:
20
Explanation:
The length of "Prime" is 5.
The length of "Minister" is 8.
The length of "of" is 2.
The length of "India" is 5.
So the sum is 20 ( 5 + 8 + 2 + 5 ).
Hence the output is 20
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
He    is my    friend
Output:
12


a,s=list(map(str,input().split())),0
for i in a:
    s+=len(i)
print(s)
