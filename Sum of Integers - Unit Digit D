Sum of Integers - Unit Digit D
The program must accept an integer N and a digit D as the input. The program must print the sum of the integers from 1 to N which have the
unit digit as D as the output. If there is no such integer from 1 to N then the program must print -1 as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
0 <= D <= 9
Input Format:
The first line contains the values of N and D seperated by space.
Output Format:
The first line contains either the sum of the integers from 1 to N which have the unit digit as D or -1.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
30 3
Output:
39
Explanation:
The integers from 1 to 30 which have the unit digit as 3 are 3, 13 and 23.
So the sum is 39 ( 3 + 13 + 23 ).
Hence the output is 39
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5 7
Output:
-1



m,n=map(int,input().split())
s=0
for i in range(1,m+1):
    if i%10==n:
        s+=i
if s==0:
    s-=1
print(s)
