Sum of Multiples of X from M to N
The program must accept three integers M, N and X as the input. The program must print the sum of multiples of X from M to N as the output. If
there is no multiple of X from M to N then the program must print -1 as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= M <= N
1 <= X <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains the values of M, N and X separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains either the sum of multiples of X from M to N or -1.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 25 3
Output:
105
Explanation:
The multiples of 3 from 5 to 25 are 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24.
So their sum is 105 (6 + 9 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 21 + 24).
Hence the output is 105
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
10 20 33
Output:
-1



m,n,x=map(int,input().split())
s=0
for i in range(m,n+1):
    if i%x==0:
        s+=i
if s==0:
    s-=1
print(s)
