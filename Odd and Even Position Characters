Odd and Even Position Characters

The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must print the characters which are present at the odd positions in the string S then print the characters which are present at the even positions in the string S as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 100Â 

Input Format:
The first line contains the string S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the characters which are present at the odd positions in S.
The second line contains the characters which are present at the even positions in S.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
Skillrack

Output:
Silak
klrc

Explanation:
The characters which are present at the odd positions in the string "Skillrack" are S, i, l, a, and k.
The characters which are present at the even positions in the string "Skillrack" are k, l, r, and c.
Hence the output is
Silak
klrc

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
action

Output:
ato
cin


n=input().strip()
s=''
for i in range(len(n)):
    if i%2==0:
        print(n[i],end='')
    else:
        s+=n[i]
print('\n',s)
