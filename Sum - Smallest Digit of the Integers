Sum - Smallest Digit of the Integers

The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must print the sum of the smallest digit in each integer among N integers as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each Integer Value <= 10^15

Input Format:
The first line contains the integer N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).

Output Format:
The first line contains the sum of the smallest digit in each integer among N integers.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6
98 765 296 43 1 2673

Output:
21

Explanation:
The smallest digit in the numbers 98, 765, 296, 43, 1 and 2673 are 8, 5, 2, 3, 1 and 2 respectively.
So their sum is 21 (8 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2).
Hence the output is 21

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4
6097 9674 2313 4407

Output:
5



n,s=int(input()),0
a=list(map(str,input().split()))
for i in a:
    s+=int(min(i))
print(s)
