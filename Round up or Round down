Round up or Round down

The program must accept N integers as the input. For each integer (among N integers) the program must round up the integer to the next multiple of 10 if its unit digit is 5 or more. Else the program must round down the integer to the previous multiple of 10. Finally, the program must print the sum of N rounded integers as the output.
Note: If an integer is a multiple of 10 then no need to round up or round down.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^8

Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).

Output Format:
The first line contains the sum of N rounded integers.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3
16 12 35

Output:
70

Explanation:
16 rounds up to 20.
12 rounds down to 10.
35 rounds up to 40.
So their sum is 70 (20+10+40).
Hence the output is 70

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5
12 490 28 11 70

Output:
610



n=int(input())
a=list(map(int,input().split()))
s=0
for i in a:
    t=i%10
    if t==0:
        s+=i
    elif t>=5:
        s+=((i//10)*10)+10
    else:
        s+=((i//10)*10)
print(s)
