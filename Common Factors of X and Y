Common Factors of X and Y

The program must accept two integers X and Y as the input. The program must print all the common factors of X and Y in ascending order as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X, Y <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers X and Y separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains all the common factors of X and Y in ascending order separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
24 96

Output:
1 2 3 4 6 8 12 24

Explanation:
The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24.
The factors of 96 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48 and 96.
The common factors in both 24 and 96 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24.
Hence the output is 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 24

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
13 19

Output:
1


m,n=map(int,input().split())
for i in range(1,n+1):
    if n%i==0 and m%i==0:
        print(i)
[10:19 PM, 2/15/2019] Kamalesh: Chocolate Bars

ABC wants to buy exactly X kilograms of chocolate. In a chocolate shop, there are N small bar chocolates (1Kg each) and M big bar chocolates (5Kg each). The values of X, N and M are passed as input to the program. The program must print the number of small bars required to buy, assuming ABC always need big bars before small bars. If ABC is not possible to buy X kilograms of chocolate then the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X, N, M <= 10^7

Input Format:
The first line contains the values of X, N and M separated by space(s).

Output Format:
The first line contains either the number of small bars are required to buy X kilograms of chocolate or -1.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
9 5 1

Output:
4

Explanation:
X = 9
4 small bars (4 * 1kg) + 1 big bar (1 * 5kg)
4 + 5 = 9
The number of small bars required = 4.
Hence the output is 4

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
13 6 1

Output:
-1





x,n,m=map(int,input().split())
b=m*5
s=x-b
if s>n:
    s=s-(s+1)
if b>=x%5:
    s=x%5
if n<x%5:
    s=-1
print(s)
