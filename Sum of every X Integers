Sum of every X Integers

The program must accept N integers and an integer X (where X is the factor of N) as the input. The program must print the sum of every X integers among N integers as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Each integer value <= 1000
1 <= X <= N

Input Format:
The first line contains the integer N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).
The third line contains the integer X.

Output Format:
The first line contains the sum of every X integers among N integers separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
8
2 3 4 9 8 7 1 5
4

Output:
18 21

Explanation:
The first 4 integers are 2, 3, 4 and 9. So their sum is 18.
The next 4 integers are 8, 7, 1 and 5. So their sum is 21.
Hence the output is 18 21

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
9
21 7 46 37 5 73 6 8 9
1

Output
21 7 46 37 5 73 6 8 9





n,s=int(input()),0
a=list(map(int,input().split()))
x=int(input())
t=x
while t<=len(a):
    print(sum(a[s:t]))
    s=t
    t+=x
