Maximum Product

The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must print the product P of any two integers among N integers so that the value of the product is maximum.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^8

Input Format:
The first line contains the integer N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).

Output Format:
The first line contains the value of P.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
10 5 1 7 2

Output:
70

Explanation:
The value of the maximum product is 70 (10 * 7).
Hence the output is 70

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4
4 2 4 9

Output:
36


n=int(input())
a=list(map(int,input().split()))
s=max(a)
a.pop(a.index(s))
t=max(a)
print(s*t)
