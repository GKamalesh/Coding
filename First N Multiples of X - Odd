First N Multiples of X - Odd
The program must accept two integers N and X as the input. The program must print the first N multiples of X which are odd as the
output. If there is no such multiple then the program must print -1 as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N, X <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains the values of N and X separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the first N multiples of X which are odd or -1.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10 3
Output:
3 9 15 21 27 33 39 45 51 57
Explanation:
The multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and so on.
The first 10 multiples of 3 and also the odd integers are 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51 and 57.
Hence the output is 3 9 15 21 27 33 39 45 51 57
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
20 2
Output:
-1


m,n=map(int,input().split())
t,l,a=0,1,1
while t<m:
    a=n*l
    if a%2==1:
        print(a,end=" ")
        t+=1
    l+=1
if t==0:
    print("-1")
