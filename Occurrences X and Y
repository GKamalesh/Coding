Occurrences X and Y

The program must accept N integers and two integers X, Y as the input. The program must print YES if the number of occurrences of X is greater than or equal to the number of occurrences of Y. Else the program must print NO as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= X, Y, Each integer value <= 10^8

Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).
The third line contains the values of X and Y separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains either YES or NO.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
8 8 3 8 3
8 3

Output:
YES

Explanation:
The number of occurrences of 8 is 3.
The number of occurrences of 3 is 2.
So 8 occurs more than 3.
Hence the output is YES

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7
17 12 13 12 13 14 13
12 13

Output:
NO



n=int(input())
l=list(map(int,input().split()))
x,y=map(int,input().split())
c=l.count(x)
s=l.count(y)
if c>=s:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
