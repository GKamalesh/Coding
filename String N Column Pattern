String N Column Pattern
The program must accept a string S and an integer N as the input. The program must print the string as shown in the Example Input/Output
section as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100
1 <= N <= Length of S
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
apple 2
Output:
ap
pl
e
Explanation:
At the first line, the first 2 characters of S are ap. So, ap is printed.
At the second line, the next 2 characters of S are pl. So pl is printed.
At the third line, there is only one character in S, so e is printed
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
environment 5
Output:
envir
onmen
t




#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<string.h>
int main()
{
    int i=0,j,n,m;
    char a[1000];
    scanf("%s",a);
    scanf("%d",&m);
    n=strlen(a);
    while(i<n)
    {
      for(j=i;j<i+m;j++)
      {
          if(j<n)
          printf("%c",a[j]);
      }
      i+=m;
     printf("\n");
    }
}
