Sum of Unique Digits - Two Integers
The program must accept two integers M and N as the input. The program must print YES if the sum of unique digits in M and the sum of unique
digits in N are equal. Else the program must print NO as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= M, N <= 10^9
Input Format:
The first line contains the values of M and N separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains either YES or NO.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
2452 9222
Output:
YES
Explanation:
The sum of unique digits in 2452 is 11 (2+4+5).
The sum of unique digits in 9222 is 11 (9+2).
So the sum of unique digits in 2542 and 9222 are equal.
Hence the output is YES
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
121 3035
Output:
NO




a,b=map(str,input().split())
t,s,c=0,0,0
for i in a:
    if i not in a[:t]:
        s+=int(i)
    t+=1
t=0
for i in b:
    if i not in b[:t]:
        c+=int(i)
    t+=1
if s==c:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
