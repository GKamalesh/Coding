Reverse the Even Digits
The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print the even digits of N in reverse order as the output. If there is no
even digit in N then the program must print -1 as the output.
Note: The leading zero(s) must be removed in the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^8
Input Format:
The first line contains the integer N.
Output Format:
The first line contains either the even digits of N in reverse order or -1.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5264380
Output:
8462
Explanation:
The even digits in 5264380 are 2, 6, 4, 8 and 0. So print the even digits in reverse order as 8462. Here the leading zero is removed.
Hence the output is 8462
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
13579
Output:
-1




a,t=input()[::-1],-1
b=[]
for i in a:
    if int(i)%2==0:
        b.append(int(i))
if len(b)==0:
    print("-1")
else:
    for i in range(len(b)):
        if b[i]!=0:
            t=i
            break
    if t==-1:
        print("0")
    else:
        for i in range(t,len(b)):
            print(b[i],end="")
