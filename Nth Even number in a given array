Write a C function to find the kth occurrence of an even integer in a sequence of non-negative integers, and then call your function from main. 

Your function should be according to the following declaration:

int find_even(int k);

Input
You are given the input in two lines:

The first line contains a positive integer k. 
In the second line, you will be given a sequence of numbers. 

You have to find the kth occurrence of n in the sequence below. 

The second line consists of a sequence of non-negative integers,
terminated with a -1.  The -1 is not part of the sequence.

Output
If there are  k even numbers in the sequence, then output the  kth
occurrence of even in the sequence. Otherwise, output a -1.


Sample Input
2
1 1 3 2 3 4 -1

Sample Output

for(j=0;j<=i;j++)
{
  if(a[j]%2==0)
  {
    b[k]=a[j];
    k++;
  }
