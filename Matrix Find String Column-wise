Matrix Find String Column-wise
The program must accept a character matrix of size NxN and a string S as the input. The program must
check if the string S is present in the matrix column-wise and print the column number of the columns with
the given string in it. Else if the string S is not present in any column of the matrix then the program must
print -1 as the output.
Note: The character matrix and the string S contain only lower case alphabets.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Length of S <= 100
Input Format:
The rst line contains the value N.
The next N lines contain N characters each separated by a space.
The (N+2) line contains the string S.
Output Format:
The rst line contains either -1 or the column number values with the given string each separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
n q w f r
e r n u o
p o b r c
r c g t k
j k j k n
rock
Output:
2 5
Explanation:
The string rock is present in the 2 and 5 column which are highlighted below.
n q w f r
e r n u o
p o b r c
r c g t k
j k j k n
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3
o v r
k b m
a k t
to

Output:
-1
