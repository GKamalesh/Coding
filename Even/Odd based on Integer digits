Even/Odd based on Integer digits
The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print the output based on the conditions given below.
- If the count of even digits is greater than the count of odd digits in N then the program must print even as the output.
- If the count of odd digits is greater than the count of even digits in N then the program must print odd as the output.
- If the count of even digits and the count of odd digits are equal in N then the program must print -1 as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^7
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
Output Format:
The first line contains either the string value odd/even or -1.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
12438
Output:
even
Explanation:
The count of odd digits in 12438 is 2.
The count of even digits in 12438 is 3.
Here the count of even digits (3) is greater than the count of odd digits (2).
Hence the output is even
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
1298
Output:
-1


n,e,o=int(input()),0,0
while n>0:
    if (n%10)%2==0:
        e+=1
    else:
        o+=1
    n//=10
if e>o:
    print("even")
elif o>e:
    print("odd")
else:
    print("-1")
