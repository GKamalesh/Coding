Explanation 0

Train 1 has arrived at 10:30 and departs at 10:45.
Train 2 arriving at 10:35 cannot use that platform, hence it needs to use a separate platform.
Train 3 arriving at 10:45 can use either of the platforms of the previous trains.
Train 4 arriving at 10:20 could use one platform, where Train 1 arriving later could have used another at that time.
Train 5 arriving at 12:22 doesn't affect any other trains so it need to have only that platform.
