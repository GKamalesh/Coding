Not Ending with 5 or 6
The program must accept N integers and an integer X as the input. For each integer, the
program must square the value of the integer and then add X to it. Then the program must print
all the integers except the integers which are ending with 5 or 6. If the modied values of all the
N integers are ending with 5 or 6 then the program must print -1 as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N, X <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^8
Input Format:
The rst line contains the values of N and X separated by a space.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The rst line contains either -1 or the list of integers which do not end with 5 or 6 separated by a
space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 10
3 1 4 7
Output:
19 11 59
Explanation:
The modied value of the rst integer is 19 (3 + 10).
The modied value of the second integer is 11 (1 + 10).
The modied value of the third integer is 26 (4 + 10).
The modied value of the fourth integer is 59 (7 + 10).
The modied values which do not end with 5 or 6 are 19, 11 and 59.
Hence the output is 19 11 59
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4 2
2 18 22 8
Output:
-1



n,x=map(int,input().split())
l=list(map(int,input().split()))
c,s=0,0
for i in a:
    t=i*i+x
    if t%10!=5 and t%10!=6:
        print(t,end=" ")
        c=1
if c==0:
    print(-1)
