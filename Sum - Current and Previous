Sum - Current and Previous
The program must accept N integers as the input. For each integer among the N integers, the
program must increment the integer by the previous value in the original input sequence. Since
there is no integer present before the rst integer, it must be incremented by the integer value
present in the last position. Then the program must print the modied values as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
0 <= Each integer value <= 10^7
Input Format:
The rst line contains the value of N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The rst line contains the modied values separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
6 5 3 2 8
Output:
14 11 8 5 10
Explanation:
The sum of the rst integer and the last integer (6+8) is 14.
The sum of the second integer and the rst integer (5+6) is 11.
The sum of the third integer and the second integer (3+5) is 8.
The sum of the fourth integer and the third integer (2+3) is 5.
The sum of the fth integer and the fourth integer (8+2) is 10.
Hence the output is 14 11 8 5 10
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7
12 23 34 45 56 67 89
Output:
101 35 57 79 101 123 156



n,t=int(input()),-1

        print(i+a[-1])
    else:
        print(i+a[t])
    t+=1
