Sum or Product of Digits

The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print the sum of the digits in N if N is even. Else the program must print the product of digits in N as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^18

Input Format:
The first line contains the integer N.

Output Format:
The first line contains either the sum of the digits in N or the product of digits in N.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
453652

Output:
25

Explanation:
The integer 453652 is odd. So the sum of the digits in 453652 is 25 (4 + 5 + 3 + 6 + 5 + 2).
Hence the output is 25

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
21841

Output:
64



n=input()
s=0
p=1
if int(n)%2==0:
    for i in n:
        s+=int(i)
    print(s)
else:
    for i in n:
        p*=int(i)
    print(p)
