X Occurrs Exactly X Times
The program must accept N integers and an integer X as the input. The program must print YES
if X occurs exactly X times. Else the program must print NO as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N, X <= 1000
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^8
Input Format:
The rst line contains the value of N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).
The third line contains the value of X.
Output Format:
The rst line contains either YES or NO.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
2 1 5 2 4
2
Output:
YES
Explanation:
Here 2 occurs exactly 2 times.
Hence the output is YES
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
8
5 7 5 6 5 8 10 5
5
Output:
NO



n=int(input())
a=list(map(int,input().split()))
x=int(input())
if x==a.count(x):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
