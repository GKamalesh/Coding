Product of X and Sum of Digits

The program must accept two integers N and X as the input. The program must print the product of X and the sum of digits in N as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N, X <= 10^9

Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
The second line contains the value of X.

Output Format:
The first line contains the product of X and the sum of digits in N.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
2345
4

Output:
56

Explanation:
The sum of digits in 2345 is 14.
The product of 4 and 14 is 56.
Hence the output is 56 

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
1000
99999

Output:
99999



n=input().strip()
x,s=int(input()),0
for i in n:
    s+=int(i)
print(s*x)
