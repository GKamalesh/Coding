Replace Odd and Even Digits
The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must replace the odd digits by 1 and replace the even digits by 0 in N.
Finally, the program must print the modified value of N as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^7
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the modified value of N.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
2345
Output:
0101
Explanation:
The digits 2 and 4 are even in 2345, so replace 2 and 4 as 0 (0305).
The digits 3 and 5 are odd in 0305, so replace 3 and 5 as 1 (0101).
Hence the output is 0101
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
657762
Output:
011100



a=input().strip()
for i in a:
    if int(i)%2==0:
        print("0",end="")
    else:
        print("1",end="")
