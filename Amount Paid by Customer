Amount Paid by Customer
A customer buys three items in a shop. If exactly two items have the same price, then a 10% discount is applied to those two items. The program
must accept three integers X, Y and Z as the price of the three items and then the program must print the amount to be paid by the customer
with the precision up to two decimal places as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X, Y, Z <= 10^5
Input Format:
The first line contains three integers X, Y and Z separated by space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the amount to be paid by the customer with the precision up to two decimal places.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
100 200 200
Output:
460.00
Explanation:
The prices of the last two items are 200 and 200. Here the prices of the two items are same. 10% of 200 is 20.
After 10% discount is applied (for 200) the price to be paid is 180 (200-20).
Hence the output is 460.00 (100.00+180.00+180.00)
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
450 150 250
Output:
850.00



a,b,c=map(float,input().split())
if a==b and b!=c:
    print("%.2f"%(a-a/10+b-b/10+c))
elif a==c and b!=c:
    print("%.2f"%(a-a/10+b+c-c/10))
elif c==b and c!=a:
    print("%.2f"%(a+b-b/10+c-c/10))
else:
    print("%.2f"%(a+b+c))
