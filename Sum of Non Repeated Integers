Sum of Non Repeated Integers
The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must print the sum of non repeated integers as the output. If there is no non
repeated integer then the program must print -1 as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^5
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains either the sum of non repeated integers or -1.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
1 2 3 2 5
Output:
9
Explanation:
Non repeated integers are 1, 3 and 5.
So, the sum of 1, 3 and 5 is 9.
Hence the output is 9
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7
87 23 87 23 67 87 67
Output:
-1



n,t,s=int(input()),0,0
a=list(map(int,input().split()))
for i in a:
    if i not in a[:t] and i not in a[t+1:]:
        s+=i
    t+=1
if s==0:
    s-=1
print(s)
