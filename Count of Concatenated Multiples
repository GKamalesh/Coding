Count of Concatenated Multiples
The program must accept an integer array of size N and an integer X as the input. The program must print the count of pairs in the array such
that the concatenation(s) of two integers in the pair is a multiple of X. For example, the concatenations of 25 and 40 are 2540 and 4025.
Note: A pair cannot be formed with the integer at the same position in the array.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
1 <= X <= 999
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N and X separated by space(s).
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains the count of pairs which are the multiples of X.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 11
45 1 10 12 11
Output:
7
Explanation:
There are 7 pairs which produce the multiples of 11. They are
(45, 1)  -> 451
(45, 10) -> 4510
(10, 45) -> 1045
(1, 10)  -> 110
(12, 1)  -> 121
(10, 12) -> 1012
(12, 10) -> 1210
Hence the output is 7
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3 12
12 12 11
Output:
2
