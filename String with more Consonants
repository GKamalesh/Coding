String with more Consonants
The program must accept two string values S1 and S2 as the input. The program must print the
string having the most number of consonants. If both the string values have the same number
of consonants then the program must print the string having the larger length as the output.
Note: The input string values will not have the same number of consonants with the same
length.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S1, S2 <= 100
Input Format:
The rst line contains the string S1.
The second line contains the string S2.
Output Format:
The rst line contains either the string S1 or S2 based on the conditions mentioned above.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
rst
cry
Output:
rst
Explanation:
The string "first" has 4 consonants.
The string "cry" has 3 consonants.
So 4 is greater than 3.
Hence the output is rst
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
about
hello
Output:
hello


a=input().strip()
b=input().strip()
c=0
s=0
for i in a:
    if i not in 'aeiouAEIOU':
        c+=1
for i in b:
    if i not in 'aeiouAEIOU':
        s+=1
if c>s:
    print(a)
elif s>c:
    print(b)
else:
    if(len(a)>len(b)):
        print(a)
    else:
        print(b)
