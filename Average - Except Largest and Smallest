Average - Except Largest and Smallest

The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must print the average M of all the integers with the precision up to two decimal places except the largest and smallest values among N integers as the output. If there are multiple copies of the smallest value, ignore just one copy, and likewise for the largest value.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= N <= 10^6
1 <= Each integer value <= 999

Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).

Output Format:
The first line contains the value of M.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
22 11 56 97

Output:
39.00

Explanation:
Here the largest integer is 97 and the smallest integer is 11.
So the average of 22 and 56 is 39.00
Hence the output is 39.00

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7
75 36 80 43 67 80 25

Output:
60.20
