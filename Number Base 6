Number Base 6  

The program accepts an integer N as the input. The program must print the integer with base as 6.

Boundary Condition:
1 <= N <= 10^18

Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.

Output Format:
The first line contains the integer N with base as 6.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
15

Output:
23

Explanation:
15%6 is 3, then 15/6 = 2
Now 2%6 is 2, then 2/6 = 0
Hence the output is 23Â 

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
153

Output:
413


import sys

if _name_ == '_main_':
    n=input()
    s=0
    while n>0:
        s=s*10+n%6
        n//=6
    print(str(s)[::-1])
