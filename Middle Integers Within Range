Middle Integers Within Range

N integers are passed as input to the program. The program must print YES if all the N-2 integers between first and last integers are greater than the first integer and lesser than the last (Nth) integer. Else the program must print NO as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains either YES or NO

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
10 20 12 18 90

Output:
YES

Explanation:
20 12 18 - all three are greater than 10 and lesser than 90. Hence YES is printed.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5
10 20 12 18 19

Output:
NO

Explanation:
20 is not lesser than 19. Hence NO is printed.



n=int(input())
a=list(map(int,input().split()))
if min(a[1:-1])>a[0] and max(a[1:-1])<a[-1]:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
