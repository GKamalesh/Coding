Last X digits Multiplied by M
The program must accept three integers N, X and M as the input. The program must print the integer formed by the last X digits
multiplied by M as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^8
1 <= X <= 9
1 <= M <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains the integer N.
The second line contains two integers X and M separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the integer formed by the last X digits multiplied by M.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
325687
3 10
Output:
6870
Explanation:
In 325687, the integer formed by the last 3 digits is 687.
Then the integer 687 is multiplied by 10. So the integer becomes 6870 (687*10=6870).
Hence the output is 6870
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
987654
5 1000
Output:
87654000



n=input().strip()
x,m=map(int,input().split())
print(int(n[-x:])*m)
