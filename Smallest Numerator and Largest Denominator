Smallest Numerator and Largest Denominator
The program must accept N fractions as the input. The program must print the smallest value in the numerator among N fractions and
then the print the largest value in the denominator among N fractions as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each Numerator Value, Denominator Value <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains the integer N.
The second line contains the N fractions separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains the smallest value in the numerator among N fractions and the largest value in the denominator among N
fractions separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
2/5 1/8 4/6 7/3
Output:
1 8
Explanation:
The smallest value in the numerator among the fractions 2/5 1/8 4/6 7/3 is 1.
The largest value in the denominator among the fractions 2/5 1/8 4/6 7/3 is 8.
Hence the output is 1 8
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7
5/4 6/7 8/7 7/3 4/5 4/6 5/7
Output:
4 7
