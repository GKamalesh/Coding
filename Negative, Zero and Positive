Negative, Zero and Positive
N integers are passed as the input to the program. The program must print the negative
integers, followed by zeroes and nally the positive numbers in the reverse order of their
occurrence.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
Input Format:
The rst line contains the value of N.
The second line contains the N integers separated by a space.
Output Format:
The rst line contains N integers separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
7
10 -90 66 0 22 0 -14
Output:
-14 -90 0 0 22 66 10
Explanation:
The negative integers from the end are -14 -90.
There are two zeroes.
The positive integers from the end are 22 66 10.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5
10 20 -88 98 -90
Output:
-90 -88 98 20 10
