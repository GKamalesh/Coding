A set of N positive integers are passed as the input. Another number X which may or may not be present in these N integers is also passed as the input. The program must print the sum of the values (in the N integers) which are less than or equal to X).

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= N <= 20

Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
The second line contains N numbers.
The third line contains the value of X.

Output Format:
The first line contains the sum of the Â values.
