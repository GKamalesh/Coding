Count of Possible Palindromes
The program must accept a space separated string S as the input. The program must print the count of all possible palindromes which can be
formed by concatenating any two words in the given string as the output.
Note: The words can be concatenated in any order.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains the space separated string.
Output Format:
The first line contains the count of all possible palindromes which can be formed by concatenating any two words in the given string.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
abcd dcba lls s sssll ll abcd llsll
Output:
9
Explanation:
The possible palindromes are abcddcba dcbaabcd dcbaabcd llssssll llsll llsllsll slls llsssll abcddcba
Here the count of possible palindromes is 9.
Hence the output is 9
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
abcd p oop ere p 
Output:
4
Explanation:
The possible palindromes are poop pp pp poop
Here the count of possible palindromes is 4.
Hence the output is 4

        if t==t[::-1] and f!=n:
            #print(t[::-1])
            c+=1
        f+=1
    n+=1
