String to Matrix with C Columns
The program must accept a string S.The program must print S as a matrix with C columns. The value of C is passed as the input. If the last row is
not filled with C characters, then pad the remaining columns with * as shown in the Example Input/Output section.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains the string S and an integer C separated by a space.
Output Format:
The list of lines containing the matrix as shown in the Example Input/Output section.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
skillrack 4
Output:
skil
lrac
k***
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
dailychallenge 5
Output:
daily
chall

a,m=map(str,input().split())
n,t=int(m),0
r=len(a)%n
if r!=0:
    r=n-r
b=list(a)
for i in range(r):
    b.append("*")
for i in b: 
    if t==n:        
        print() 
        t=0
    print(i,end="")
    t+=1
