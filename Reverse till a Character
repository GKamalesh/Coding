Reverse till a Character

The program must accept a string S and a character CH as the input. The program must reverse the String S till the first occurrence of the character CH and print it as the output. If CH has not occurred in S then print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains the string S.
The second line contains the character CH.

Output Format:
The first line contains either the reversed string till the first occurrence of the character CH or -1.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
skillrack
l

Output:
liks

Explanation:
The characters up to the first occurrence of l in the string "skillrack" are s, k, i and l.
So the reverse of "skil" is "liks".
Hence the output is liks

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
hello
x

Output:
-1



a=input().strip()
c=input()
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] is c:
        print(a[:i+1][::-1])
        break
if c not in a:
    print("-1").
