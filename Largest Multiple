the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X <= 10^8
1 <= Y <= X
Input Format:
The first line contains two integers X and Y separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the largest multiple of Y.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
25 7
Output:
21
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
89 19
Output:
76




m,n=map(int,input().split())
t=n
for i in range(m-1,n,-1):
    if i%n==0:
        t=i
        break
print(t)
