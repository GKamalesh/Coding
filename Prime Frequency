Prime Frequency
The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must print YES if the frequency of all the characters in S are prime numbers. Else
the program must print NO as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 10000
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of string S.
Output Format:
The first line contains either YES or NO.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
cpppcpcp
Output:
YES
Explanation:
The frequency of character c is 3
The frequency of character p is 5
Here both 3 and 5 are prime numbers.
Hence the output is YES
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
Hello
Output:
NO



=input().strip()
b=[]
s=0
for i in a:
    b.append(a.count(i))
for i in b:
    if i==1:
        s=1
        break
    for j in range(2,i):
        if i%j==0:
            s=1
            break
if s==1:
    print("NO")
else:
    print("YES")
