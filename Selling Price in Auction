Selling Price in Auction
An antique item is to be sold in an auction. The starting price of the item is S. The price is increased by I in each bid. The number of bids
to be placed is limited to N. The seller expects an amount of at least E. The program must accept 4 integers S, I, N and E as the input. The
program must print yes if the item can be sold for the amount greater than or equal to the expected price E. Else the program must print
no as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= S, E <= 1000000
1 <= N, I <= 10000
Input Format:
The first line contains the values of S, I, N and E separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains either yes or no.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
100 5 10 150
Output:
yes
Explanation:
The starting price is 100.
The maximum number of bids to be placed is 10.
So the maximum selling price is 100+(10x5) = 150.
Hence the output is yes.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
200 5 50 500
Output:
no



a,b,c,d=map(int,input().split())
if b*c+a>=d:
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")
